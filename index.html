          The CSS Multi-column Layout Module extends the block layout mode to 
          allow the easy definition of multiple columns of text. People have trouble 
          reading text if lines are too long; if it takes too long for the eyes to move
           from the end of the one line to the beginning of the next, they lose track 
           of which line they were on.
